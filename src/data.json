His record as all-time skipper of the Chennai Super Kings in IPL is equally stunning – four crowns, nine finals, playoffs in every season except one. All this, apart from leading the team to two Champions League T20 trophies in 2010 and 2014. The wicketkeeper-batsman had a stellar international career from 2004 to 2019, where he amassed more than 17000 runs across three formats. It included 10773 runs in ODIs, where he averaged in excess of 50. The Super Kings captain has played 220 IPL matches, scoring 4746 runs including 23 half-centuries. ",
